1.0 – General Conduct & Professionalism
1.1. Common Sense
• Members are expected to apply common sense in all situations. Not every circumstance can be covered by the handbook, so it is your responsibility to act reasonably, professionally, and with respect for others. Rules are written to guide behavior, but your judgment must align with the spirit of these expectations. Unreasonable behavior or attempts to exploit “loopholes” will still result in disciplinary action.
1.2. Discord Terms of Service
• All members must comply with Discord Terms of Service at all times. This includes avoiding harassment, hate speech, scams, illegal activity, or the use of unauthorized bots or clients. Violations of Discord’s ToS risk the safety of GVRO as a community and will result in immediate removal.
1.3. Roblox Terms of Service
• The Roblox Terms of Service apply whenever you are representing GVRO. Exploiting, bypassing filters, glitching, or engaging in prohibited activity on Roblox will not be tolerated. Such actions damage GVRO’s reputation and will result in permanent removal from GVRO Public Services.
1.4. Confidentiality
• Confidentiality is essential. Members must not leak or share private GVRO information, including restricted channels, documents, discussions, or assets. Doing so undermines trust, threatens the security of operations, and will result in immediate termination and an unappealable blacklist.
1.5. Professionalism & Respect
• Professional conduct is expected at all times. Members must remain respectful, patient, and courteous when interacting with civilians, staff, or other service members. Profanity, hostile language, or toxic behavior will not be tolerated. Maintaining professionalism helps ensure realistic roleplay and builds GVRO’s reputation as a serious and respectful community.
1.6. Abuse of Authority
• Authority is a privilege, not a right. Any misuse of staff tools such as warnings, kicks, mutes, or bans will be considered abuse of authority. Actions taken out of anger, personal bias, or without proper cause erode trust and damage GVRO. Abuse of authority will result in immediate disciplinary action, up to termination.
1.7. Drama
• Drama is disruptive to both staff and roleplay. Conflicts with members or staff must be handled professionally through tickets, where senior staff will review the matter. Public arguments, gossip, or instigating drama creates tension and undermines GVRO’s image. Failure to handle conflicts properly will result in disciplinary action.
1.8. Moderation Enforcement
• When issuing punishments, staff must provide valid evidence. Screenshots, recordings, or logs are required for transparency and fairness. If no evidence is available, the punishment may be overturned, and the issuing staff member may face consequences. Fair, consistent, and documented enforcement ensures credibility and protects both staff and members.
1.9. Social Media & External Conduct
• Members are representatives of GVRO even outside of Roblox/Discord. Negative behavior, harassment, or toxicity directed at others in external servers, games, or platforms can still result in action within GVRO. We expect professionalism wherever GVRO’s name is represented.
1.10. Misuse of Tickets or Reports
• Tickets and reporting systems must only be used for legitimate issues. Submitting false reports, spamming tickets, or using the system to harass others wastes staff time and will result in disciplinary action.
1.11. Interdepartment Cooperation
• Departments must work together professionally. Rivalries, interference with other department roleplay scenes, or “one-upping” behavior is not tolerated. Cross-department respect ensures smoother operations.
1.12. Chain of Command Respect
• Members must respect the authority of higher-ranking staff and department leaders. Disrespect, insubordination, or ignoring directives disrupts operations and will not be tolerated.
1.13. Event & Training Attendance
• If you register or are required to attend an official GVRO event or training, you must show up on time unless excused. Repeated absences without valid reasons may result in disciplinary action or removal from your department.
1.14. Department Transfers
• Members may not switch departments at will. Transfers require approval from both department heads and leadership. Unauthorized transfers or “double-dipping” (being in two departments at once without approval) will result in removal.
1.15. Use of Language & Communication
• Members must use clear, respectful language in roleplay and staff communication. Excessive use of slang, trolling, or intentionally disruptive communication (such as spamming radio/chat) will not be tolerated.
1.16. Radio & Comms Discipline
• Radio/communications must remain professional and concise. Unnecessary chatter, soundboards, music, or irrelevant conversation clutters comms and disrupts operations.
1.17. Personal Vendettas
• Moderation or roleplay actions may not be taken to settle personal disputes. Staff and members are expected to remain neutral and professional, even when dealing with people they personally dislike.
1.18. Respect for Civilians & Non-Department Members
• Members must treat civilians and non-department participants fairly. Excessive targeting, harassment, or ignoring civilian roleplay contributions undermines realism and will result in action.
1.19. Maturity Requirement
• Members are expected to maintain maturity in all communications, regardless of age. Childish, disruptive, or unserious behavior lowers GVRO’s professionalism.
1.20. Appeals & Disputes
• Members have the right to appeal disciplinary actions through the appropriate ticket or review system. Public arguing, drama, or attempting to bypass the appeal process will not be tolerated.
1.21. AFK on Duty
• Members may not remain AFK while clocked in, in uniform, or marked on patrol. Doing so disrupts active roleplay and is considered hour-farming.
1.22. Real-Life Discretion
• Members must never share real-life personal details (such as home address, phone number, or other sensitive info) in GVRO spaces. Safety and privacy take priority over all roleplay.
1.23. LOA Communication
• If a member goes on LOA, they are expected to return on the stated date or notify staff of an extension. Failure to communicate will result in removal for inactivity.
1.24. Harassment-Free Environment
• GVRO maintains a zero-tolerance policy toward harassment. Any discriminatory behavior, bullying, or targeting of members based on personal characteristics (race, gender, religion, etc.) will result in immediate disciplinary action.
2.0 – Vehicle & Driving Conduct
2.1. Traffic Flow
• Driving against the flow of traffic while on duty is strictly prohibited. This behavior is unrealistic and unsafe. Members must follow proper lane discipline at all times unless roleplay circumstances (such as traffic control or emergencies) specifically justify otherwise.
2.2. U-Turns
• Performing U-turns over medians or other unsafe locations is prohibited. In real life, such actions would result in significant vehicle damage. Members must conduct U-turns only at safe and designated locations, such as pullover lanes or intersections.
2.3. Reckless Driving
• Reckless driving while on duty is not permitted. Examples include ignoring traffic laws, running stop signs, cutting off vehicles, or speeding excessively. While emergency responses may allow for controlled exceptions, members are expected to drive responsibly and realistically at all times.
2.4. Responding Speeds
• Members must not exceed 105 MPH (168 KM/H) while responding to emergencies or engaging in pursuits. This limit balances realism with gameplay. Excessive speeding beyond this threshold is considered unsafe and unrealistic and will result in disciplinary action.
2.5. Traffic Stops
• Traffic stops may only be performed on civilians. Members are never permitted to pull over staff, hosts/co-hosts, or other Public Services. These individuals are not roleplaying in the same context, and improper stops are disruptive. Any concerns with staff should be reported through a ticket.
2.6. Unauthorized Chases
• Unauthorized pursuits are prohibited. Only designated High Speed Unit personnel may engage in pursuits of high-risk individuals, such as leakers or mass FRPers. Unauthorized chasing disrupts sessions, creates unrealistic roleplay, and will result in discipline.
2.7. Emergency Lighting Systems (ELS)
• ELS and sirens must only be used in legitimate roleplay situations, such as active calls, traffic stops, or emergency responses. Activating lights for personal convenience, amusement, or without reason is considered abuse. Misuse of ELS will result in strikes or suspension.
2.8. Vehicle Use & Scene Realism
• Vehicles used must fit the context of the roleplay. Excessive spawning, abandoning vehicles, or using unrealistic vehicles disrupts immersion and will result in warnings. 
3.0 – Roleplay & Operational Standards
3.1. Use of Force & Roleplay Realism
• Members must use appropriate force in all roleplay interactions. Escalation of force must be proportional to the situation. Officers should not immediately resort to firearms unless the scenario realistically warrants it. Unrealistic or excessive use of force undermines immersion and may result in disciplinary action.
3.2. Corruption Roleplay
• Corruption roleplay (accepting bribes, aiding criminals, abusing power for personal gain, etc.) is strictly prohibited unless explicitly authorized by GVRO leadership for a planned event. Unauthorized corruption damages realism and disrupts fair play.
3.3. Off-Duty Conduct
• When not on duty, members must still act responsibly and not disrupt roleplay sessions. Using public safety vehicles, ELS, or staff authority while off duty is prohibited.
3.4. Use of Recording & Media
• Members may record sessions for evidence, training, or promotional purposes. However, recordings must respect member privacy and may not be shared outside GVRO without permission. Unauthorized sharing of recordings will be treated as a confidentiality violation.
3.5. Scene Ownership & Control
• Once a roleplay scene is established, it is under the control of the initiating department (e.g., fire controls fire scenes, police control law enforcement incidents). Other departments may assist but cannot take over unless directed.
3.6. Staff Powers Outside of Roleplay
• Staff must not use their powers (teleports, kicks, bans, force-ending scenes, etc.) to interfere with roleplay unless it is absolutely necessary for enforcement or safety. Abuse of powers will result in removal.
3.7. Retaliation Against Reports
• Members may not retaliate against others for filing reports, opening tickets, or cooperating with staff investigations. Retaliation includes harassment, exclusion, or targeting in future roleplays.
3.8. Mic/VC Etiquette
• If using voice communications, members must maintain a clear and professional tone. Excessive background noise, yelling, or inappropriate behavior in VC disrupts operations.
3.9. Event Interference
• Members who are not part of a scheduled training or event may not interfere, troll, or otherwise disrupt the session. Loitering, distracting, or trying to insert yourself into official events will be treated as misconduct.
3.10. Unauthorized Roleplay Scenarios
• Members may not create large-scale roleplay scenarios (riots, mass crimes, city-wide incidents, etc.) without approval from staff. All major events must be coordinated through leadership to ensure balance and fairness.
3.11. Proper Use of Department Resources
• Department resources (vehicles, gear, comms, training documents) must only be used for their intended purpose. Using them for trolling, personal gain, or outside GVRO is prohibited.
3.12. Accountability for Guests/Visitors
• Members are responsible for the behavior of guests or visitors they invite into GVRO spaces. If a guest causes disruption, the member may also be held accountable.
3.13. Conflict Resolution
• Disagreements between members should be handled privately or with staff mediation. Public arguments, hostile confrontations, or “calling out” others disrupt harmony and professionalism.
3.14. Timezones & Availability
• Members should be transparent about their activity level and timezone so departments can plan accordingly. Extended inactivity without notice may lead to removal.
3.15. Promotions & Rank Advancement
• Promotions are based on merit, activity, and professionalism. Asking for promotions or attempting to bribe/favor leadership will result in disqualification from advancement.
3.16. Training & Certification Requirements
• Members may not perform specialized duties (e.g., piloting, SWAT, K9, fire command) without completing the required training/certification. Unauthorized use of advanced roles or equipment will result in removal.
3.17. Emergency Situations (OOC Authority)
• In rare cases, staff may override regulations to protect the server, players, or integrity of an event. Such decisions are final at the time but can be reviewed afterward if needed.
3.18. Chain of Evidence (Proof Handling)
• Members must not falsify, alter, or destroy screenshots, recordings, or logs when providing evidence. Any manipulation of evidence will result in immediate termination and blacklist.
3.19. OOC vs IC Separation
• Members must distinguish between in-character (IC) roleplay actions and out-of-character (OOC) communication. Using OOC grudges to influence IC actions, or vice versa, is prohibited.
3.20. Favoritism & Bias
• Staff and department leaders must remain impartial. Favoritism, selective enforcement, or protecting friends from punishment will not be tolerated. All members are subject to the same rules.
3.21. Dual-Clanning / Unauthorized Affiliations
• Members may not represent competing or unauthorized groups while serving in GVRO Public Services. Divided loyalties compromise realism, professionalism, and security.
3.22. Use of Recording / Streaming
• Members who record or stream GVRO sessions must ensure that recordings comply with privacy, professionalism, and security standards. Sensitive information may not be shared publicly.
3.23. Staff Impersonation
• Impersonating staff or misrepresenting rank/authority is strictly prohibited. This includes falsifying callsigns, pretending to hold staff tools, or giving unauthorized orders.
3.24. Exploit / Cheat Reporting
• If a member becomes aware of exploits, cheats, or rule-breaking, they must report it through the appropriate channel. Covering up or ignoring such activity is a violation.
3.25. Alt Accounts
• Members may only use their approved account when serving in GVRO. Using alternate accounts without approval is prohibited and may result in removal.
3.26. Documentation & Logs
• Members must properly log shifts, calls, or activity when required by their department. Falsifying or failing to log activity undermines accountability and will be treated as misconduct.
3.27. Chain of Custody (Evidence Handling)
• Physical or digital evidence collected during roleplay (weapons, contraband, etc.) must be handled realistically. Destroying, duplicating, or unrealistically planting/removing evidence is prohibited.
3.28. Technology & Bots
• Members may not use unauthorized bots, macros, scripts, or third-party tools that provide unfair advantages in GVRO operations.
3.29. Transparency in Leadership
• Staff and leadership must clearly communicate decisions that affect departments or the wider membership. Concealing important information, making unexplained changes, or failing to provide reasoning erodes trust.
3.30. Safety Overrides in Roleplay
• If at any point a roleplay scenario becomes unsafe, hostile, or personally uncomfortable for members, staff may pause or end the scenario. Real-world comfort and safety take priority over immersion.
3.31. Data Security & Privacy
• Members must not attempt to gain unauthorized access to GVRO databases, files, or systems. Any attempts to compromise security will result in immediate blacklist.
4.0 – Policies, Attendance & LOA
4.1. Radio Traffic Only VC
• While on patrol, members are required to remain in Dispatch Communications channels (1 or 2). This ensures proper coordination between units and promotes smooth, organized roleplay. Failing to remain in dispatch channels disrupts operations and may result in disciplinary action.
4.2. Promotions
• Promotions are based on activity, professionalism, and overall contribution to GVRO. Leadership may award promotions when a member consistently demonstrates responsibility and respect. Inactivity without a proper LOA may result in warnings, demotion, or termination.
4.3. Resignations
• Members may resign at any time. Upon returning, they may not retain their former rank, depending on the length and circumstances of their absence. Abuse of resignations (e.g., resigning and rejoining repeatedly) will result in removal and possible blacklist. Members must wait at least 14 days before reapplying or fast-passing into the same type of department.
4.4. Leave of Absence (LOA)
• Members may request an LOA under the following rules:
  - Minimum Duration: 7 days
  - Maximum Duration: 28 days
  - Members must wait at least 10 days between LOA requests.
 
Abusing LOA to remain inactive while participating in other communities or avoiding responsibilities will result in immediate removal.
4.5. Attendance Tracking
• Members are required to log attendance for all official events, trainings, and shifts.
• Repeated failure to log attendance can result in warnings, strikes, or removal.
• Leadership may review attendance records when considering promotions or rank advancement.

4.6. Late Arrival / Early Departure
• Arriving late or leaving early without valid reason or prior notice is a violation.
• Chronic tardiness will result in disciplinary action.
• Members should notify their department head if delays are unavoidable.


4.7. LOA Extensions & Violations
• Extensions may be requested if valid circumstances occur (illness, personal emergencies).
• Failure to request an extension or communicate during LOA will be treated as inactivity and may result in removal.
• Members abusing LOA to participate in other communities while avoiding GVRO duties may face additional penalties.


4.8. Return from LOA / Resumption of Duties
• Members must check in with their department upon return from LOA.
• Failure to check in may result in temporary suspension or demotion.
• Returning members may be required to attend a refresher training before resuming full duties.

4.9. Inactivity Policy
